"""Bounded-memory subprocess capture for the harness adapters.

The adapters used to run each task with `subprocess.run(capture_output=True)`
on a verbose JSONL stream — the whole multi-megabyte log sat in memory per
concurrent task (recorded runs reach 178,606 input tokens per task,
`results/2026-08-20-pi-harness/hard-opencode.json`) while only
`stdout[-20000:]` was ever kept (`events.py`). This module streams instead:
the pipes are drained line-by-line, every complete line is folded into the
result immediately, and both streams are retained only as bounded rolling
tails. Peak memory per task is O(tail + result), not O(log).

Timeout parity with `subprocess.run`: a watchdog timer kills the child at
*timeout* seconds and the partial fold is discarded exactly as TimeoutExpired
did — a timed-out task must not look like a partially productive one.
