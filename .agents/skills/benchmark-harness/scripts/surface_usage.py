"""surface_usage.py — did the harness's skills, MCP servers and plugins do anything?

A live run enables the whole daily surface, but the result file only ever said
that the surface was *on*. It could not tell "the skills helped" from "the
skills sat there costing prompt tokens and were never called" — the two look
identical in an agent score. Every live run committed to `results/` so far is
in fact the second case, which is exactly why this exists.

Two questions, one script:

  1. **usage** — of the tool calls in a run, which were built-in, which came
     from an MCP server, and which came from a skill, plugin or extension?
  2. **A/B** — with an isolated arm to compare against, what did the surface
     actually buy? Scores, efficiency and prompt cost, side by side.

Reads only the result JSONs `bench` already writes. Prints markdown on stdout,
so the caller can append it to a report the same way the run context is
appended.
