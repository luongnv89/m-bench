# Benchmarking through a real coding harness

A model is only half of what you run. The other half is the **harness** wrapped around it —
its system prompt, its tool schemas, how it chunks edits, how much context it resends, how
many turns it will spend before giving up. The same weights behind two harnesses are two
different products.

Everything else in this repo measures a model through *benchkit's own* tool loop, which is
nobody's actual setup. This part measures it through the coding agent installed on your
machine.

```bash
./bench harness list                                   # which harnesses are installed
./bench harness models                                 # which models yours can reach
./bench harness run --harness opencode -m ollama/qwen3-coder:latest --suite agentic-hard
```

## Benchmarking *your* setup

The harness commands are built around one idea: whatever you can already run in opencode or
pi, you can benchmark, without editing your editor's configuration. Nothing here assumes a
particular endpoint or a particular model.

`bench harness models` asks each installed harness what it can reach — `opencode models` for
opencode, `pi --list-models` for pi — and prints the `provider/model` pairs. Pass one to
`--model` (`-m`), or any unique part of it: `-m qwen3-coder` resolves to
`ollama/qwen3-coder:latest`, and an ambiguous or unknown spec is answered with the candidates
*before* the run starts rather than with a provider error a second into every task.

Three ways to choose, in order of precedence:

| | |
|---|---|
| `--model <spec>` | explicit, and what scripts and CI should use |
| `BENCH_HARNESS_MODEL` | the same thing as an environment default |
| neither | you are shown a numbered list and asked, at the start of the run. A non-tty gets the list and a non-zero exit instead, so an unattended run never hangs waiting for an answer |

Credentials are yours and stay yours: the adapters read the harness's own configuration and
never write to it. The one exception is `--endpoint`.

### `--endpoint`: a server the harness does not know about

For a local vLLM or llama.cpp that is not in your harness config, `--endpoint
http://host:port/v1` points the harness at it **for this run only**. All three harnesses
accept it, and none of them writes to your own configuration to do it:

| Harness | How the endpoint is injected |
|---|---|
| `opencode` | a throwaway provider config next to the temp workspace, handed over as `OPENCODE_CONFIG` |
| `claude-code` | `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` plus a throwaway `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` |
| `pi` | a throwaway catalogue in the run's temp dir holding one synthetic provider and nothing else, handed over as `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` |

In this mode the harness catalogue does not apply, so `--model` must name the id that
endpoint serves — it is checked against the endpoint's `/models` before the run starts.
`montimage-dgx-spark` below is the id *this* DGX serves; use whatever your own
`/v1/models` reports:

```bash
./bench harness run --harness opencode --endpoint http://localhost:8001/v1 \
    -m montimage-dgx-spark --suite agentic-hard
./bench harness run --harness pi --endpoint http://localhost:8001/v1 \
    -m montimage-dgx-spark --suite agentic-hard
```

The label and result filename carry the model, not just the harness — `opencode
ollama-qwen3-coder-latest think-OFF` — because benchmarking two models through one harness is
the ordinary case, and a file named after the harness alone would overwrite one run with the
other.

## Benchmark your live setup (`bench setup`)

`bench harness run` isolates on purpose: pi runs with `--no-extensions`, opencode with
`--pure`, Claude Code without skills or MCP servers — so the *model* is what varies.
Sometimes the opposite question is the interesting one: **is my daily setup any good, and
what should I change about it?**

```bash
./bench setup --harness pi --suite agentic-hard
```

`bench setup run` is `bench harness run` in **live mode**: every isolation flag is dropped
and the harness runs exactly as you experience it — extensions, slash-command skills,
MCP servers, settings files and (for Claude Code) the full built-in tool set all included.
Nothing to reconfigure; point it at the repo and go. The result json lands in `results/`
as usual, and a `REPORT-live.md` is written beside it ending in a **Suggestions** section:
heuristic advice derived from the run's own numbers — context bloat traced back to installed
skills/MCP servers, turn-limit hits pointing at missing tools, low valid-call rates pointing
at schema mismatches, and so on.

**The contamination caveat, stated once more:** a live setup can contain components that
call other models (pi extensions and advisor tools are the usual offenders). A live-mode
score measures the *whole setup*, whatever models it actually used. Every live result file
records which isolation flags were disabled and carries that caveat in its metadata; do not
quote a live number as a model number.

Live results stamp `live` in both the config metadata and the label (`pi live prov-model
think-OFF`), so they sort apart from isolated runs when reports compare setups.

## What stays the same

Scoring. A task is still solved when `check(ws)` says the final workspace is right, and
**par still comes from our oracle**. That matters more than it looks: par measures the
*task*, not the harness, so it is the one ruler that stays fixed while the thing being
measured changes. A harness that reaches the same goal state in fewer calls is genuinely
more efficient, and the agent score says so.

## What changes

The workspace becomes a real temp directory instead of an in-memory dict, because external
harnesses drive a filesystem. The harness runs with that directory as its working
directory, and whatever it leaves behind is read back and scored.

Two consequences worth stating plainly:

- **The harness runs real commands on your machine**, in a temp directory, with whatever
  permissions you have. That is the point — it is what your harness does every day — but it
  is not a sandbox.
- **Turn and call counts are not comparable across harnesses** without also reading the
  token columns. A harness that batches four edits into one call looks efficient until you
  see it resent 60k tokens of context to do it.

## The pi adapter

`benchkit/harness/pi.py`, driving `pi -p --mode json` and folding its JSONL event stream
into the same result shape as the built-in loop: `tool_execution_start` for calls,
`turn_start` for turns, assistant `message_end` for token usage.

Three flags in the adapter are load-bearing, and none of them is cosmetic:

| Flag | Why |
|---|---|
| `--no-extensions` | pi extensions can call **other models**. This machine's install ships an advisor extension pointed at `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol`; without this flag a frontier model sits silently inside a run that claims to measure a local one |
| `--no-context-files` | pi discovers `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` by walking up from the working directory, so without this the benchmark leaks whatever guidance sits above the temp dir |
| `--no-session` | no state carries between tasks |

`stdin` is also redirected to `/dev/null`. Without that pi blocks forever on an inherited
stdin it can never read, and every task times out with zero turns — which looks exactly
like a model that cannot use tools.

### Pointing it at a model

pi resolves models through its own catalogue and credentials, so there is nothing for the
adapter to configure. `list_models()` shells out to `pi --list-models` and returns the
provider/model pairs it prints; `available()` then re-checks the choice against
`~/.pi/agent/models.json` before a run rather than after a confusing result.

`local-dgx/montimage-dgx-spark` is the entry *this* box's pi catalogue holds for the
local vLLM. On your machine, substitute a `provider/model` pair that
`./bench harness models` actually reports.

```bash
./bench harness models --harness pi
./bench harness run --harness pi -m local-dgx/montimage-dgx-spark
./bench harness run --harness pi --provider local-dgx -m montimage-dgx-spark   # equivalent
```

### Pointing it at an endpoint it has never heard of

pi takes no base URL on the command line, so `--endpoint` is served the same way the other
two adapters serve it: with a throwaway config the run owns. `prepare()` writes a catalogue
into the run's temp directory holding a single synthetic `benchkit` provider of
`api: openai-completions` pointed at the endpoint, and exports `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` for the
subprocess only.

Your `~/.pi/agent/models.json` is never written, and in endpoint mode never even read: your
own providers are deliberately left out of the staged catalogue, so no `apiKey` of yours is
duplicated into a temp directory and nothing in the run can reach a model other than the one
being benchmarked. A run *without* `--endpoint` stages nothing at all and uses your own
catalogue and credentials unchanged. The staged catalogue lives in a *sibling* of the
workspace, so it never appears in the directory that gets read back and scored, and its path
comes from that task's own temp dir — tasks run on a thread pool and must not share it.

```bash
./bench harness run --harness pi --endpoint http://localhost:8001/v1 -m montimage-dgx-spark
```

One caveat: the staged provider describes a plain OpenAI-compatible server, so thinking is
best-effort. A model that needs a particular `compat.thinkingFormat` (the local Qwen wants
`qwen-chat-template`) is still better added to pi's own catalogue and selected with `-m`.

### Thinking

The adapter passes pi `--thinking off` or `--thinking high`, chosen by benchkit's own
`--thinking` flag — which is a boolean switch, so you write `--thinking`, not
`--thinking high`.
pi maps those onto whatever the provider's `compat.thinkingFormat` says; for the local
provider that is `qwen-chat-template`, i.e. the same `enable_thinking` kwarg the direct
suites toggle.

## Adding another harness

Subclass `Harness` in `benchkit/harness/`, implement three methods, and register it in
`benchkit/harness/__init__.py`:

```python
class MyHarness(Harness):
    name = "myharness"

    def available(self):   # (ok, detail) — check before running, not after
        ...
    def probe(self):       # (ok, detail) — is the harness itself installed?
        ...                # optional; defaults to available()
    def list_models(self): # [(provider, model)] the user's own setup can reach
        ...                # optional; [] means "cannot enumerate"
    def describe(self):    # version + config, recorded into the result file
        ...
    def run(self, workdir, prompt, timeout=900, thinking=False) -> HarnessResult:
        ...
```

`run` gets a directory containing the task's files and a prompt, and must leave the
directory in whatever state the harness produced. Everything else — materialising, reading
back, scoring, par, the agent score, the report — is already done for you.

Report what you cannot measure as zero and say so in `describe()`. A harness that does not
expose token usage should not silently look cheap.

## The opencode adapter

`benchkit/harness/opencode.py`, driving `opencode run --format json`. Events map cleanly:
`tool_use` per call (with `state.status` for failures), `step_start`/`step_finish` for steps,
and per-step token counts on `step_finish`.

By default it uses the providers you have already configured and authenticated —
`opencode models` is the catalogue, and nothing is written to
`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`.

`--endpoint` is the other mode, for a server opencode has no entry for. Editing the user's
global config to add one would change how their editor behaves, so the adapter writes a
throwaway provider config **next to** the task directory instead, and nothing lands in the
workspace the model sees or the one that gets scored.

Getting *that* to work took three findings, none of which are visible from the docs:

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Project-config discovery found the provider when the identical argv ran through a shell, and not when it was exec'd directly — every task died a second in with `ProviderModelNotFoundError` | Pass the path explicitly in `OPENCODE_CONFIG` |
| Doing that moved opencode's project root to the config file's directory, and the model then reported it could not find the task's files | Pass `--dir <workdir>` as well; it is *not* redundant with `cwd` |
| Extensions and plugins can reach other models | `--pure`, the counterpart to pi's `--no-extensions` |

`--auto` approves tool use, which is safe here only because the workspace is a throwaway temp
directory.

### Thinking

opencode exposes `--variant` for provider-specific reasoning effort rather than a boolean. The
adapter takes a `variant` argument and otherwise leaves the server's default thinking mode in
place — for the local vLLM config that is thinking ON. This is a real limitation: unlike the
direct suites and the pi adapter, `--thinking` does not currently toggle opencode runs, so
compare opencode rows against each other rather than against a specific thinking mode
elsewhere.

## A run that does nothing must not score

While the opencode adapter was failing at launch, it "passed" `verify_no_change_needed` —
whose predicate is satisfied by the source being untouched. `run_task` now fails any task
where the harness errored, timed out, or made no tool calls at all: a run that never started
cannot have solved anything. Any harness you add inherits that guard.

## The Claude Code adapter

`benchkit/harness/claudecode.py`, driving
`claude -p <prompt> --output-format stream-json --verbose`. Tool calls come from `tool_use`
content blocks on `assistant` events, failures from `is_error` on the matching `tool_result`,
and turns, stop reason and token totals from the single final `result` event.

### With `--endpoint`, it only works because the endpoint serves two APIs

Without `--endpoint` the adapter runs your own Claude Code login untouched, and `--model`
takes the usual aliases (`sonnet`, `opus`). Claude Code has no command that enumerates the
models an account can reach, so `bench harness models` lists nothing for it and the id is
taken at its word.

With `--endpoint`, the API shape matters. Claude Code speaks the **Anthropic Messages API**.
It has no OpenAI-compatibility mode, so
`BENCH_BASE_URL` — which is OpenAI-shaped, `.../v1/chat/completions` — is not usable as such.
It works here for a reason specific to this stack: vLLM implements `/v1/messages`, and
`router.py` proxies it alongside the OpenAI routes. `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` therefore points at
the API *root* (`http://localhost:8001`, no `/v1` — Claude Code appends its own).

`available()` probes `/v1/messages/count_tokens` explicitly rather than settling for a
`/v1/models` listing. An endpoint that serves OpenAI traffic and not Anthropic traffic passes
every other check and then fails every task after burning its full timeout; that is exactly
the shape of failure this repo's guard rails exist to catch early. Against such an endpoint
this adapter cannot be made to work and says so.

### Claude Code reaches further by default than pi or opencode

Two of its built-in tools would invalidate the measurement outright, and its defaults pull in
this machine's whole configuration:

| Flag | Why |
|---|---|
| `--tools Bash Read Edit Write Glob Grep` | pins the built-in set. The default includes `Task`/`Workflow`, which spawn subagents that can be pointed at **other models**, and `WebSearch`/`WebFetch`, which pull outside context into a run claiming to measure a local model. This is the counterpart to pi's `--no-extensions` and opencode's `--pure` |
| `--bare` | skips hooks, LSP, plugin sync, auto-memory and **CLAUDE.md auto-discovery** — pi's `--no-context-files` |
| `--disable-slash-commands` | skills are user-installed prompt injections; this machine has dozens |
| `--strict-mcp-config` + empty `--mcp-config` | MCP servers are arbitrary external tools |
| `--setting-sources ""` | ignore user/project/local settings files |
| `--no-session-persistence` | no state carries between tasks |
| `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` | a throwaway config home *next to* the workspace, so session and project state never lands in the scored directory and never touches the user's `~/.claude`. **Only set in `--endpoint` mode**: the login lives in that directory, so redirecting it in existing-auth mode would leave every task unauthenticated |

`--permission-mode bypassPermissions` approves tool use, safe here for the same reason as
opencode's `--auto`: the workspace is a throwaway temp directory. `stdin` is `DEVNULL`, for
the reason the pi section records. Env inherited from a *parent* Claude Code session
(`CLAUDECODE`, `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`, `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, the Bedrock/Vertex switches, …)
is scrubbed, or the child would be told it is a nested run and behave differently mid-benchmark.

### What it cannot measure

Better than the ROADMAP feared — calls, turns, stop reason and tokens are all there — with
one real gap:

- **`reasoning_tokens` is always 0.** Claude Code reports thinking tokens in
  `usage.output_tokens_details.thinking_tokens`, which the local vLLM Anthropic surface
  reports as `0` even for responses that visibly contain `thinking` blocks. Those tokens are
  billed inside `output_tokens`, so the output column is right and the reasoning column is
  not. `describe()` carries that caveat into every result file: a `0` here means *not
  measured*, not *did not think*.
- **`--thinking` does not toggle claude-code runs**, the same limitation as opencode. The
  server's default thinking mode applies. `--effort` is exposed as a constructor argument but
  is not wired to `--thinking`, because it is Claude Code's effort setting and not the
  server's `enable_thinking` kwarg, and conflating the two would make the columns lie.

Input tokens sum `input_tokens` plus both cache fields, so the column stays comparable with
pi's and opencode's, which count every token sent.

## The Devin adapter

`benchkit/harness/devin.py`, driving `devin -p <prompt> --export <file>`. Devin's
print-mode stdout is only the final response, so nothing is folded from the
stream — all telemetry comes from the ATIF export the CLI writes after every
turn: `tool_calls[].function_name` per `agent` step (calls and the trace),
`observation.results` (results), and per-step `metrics` (token usage). Turns are
the count of `agent` steps.

Devin serves Cognition-hosted models only — there is no OpenAI-compatible mode,
and `--endpoint` is refused by `available()`. `list_models()` parses
`devin models list` into (family, model) pairs, so `-m swe-2-max` or
`-m claude-opus-5` resolve against the account's real catalogue. Authentication
is the user's own `devin auth` login (`credentials.toml`).

### What isolated mode strips — and what it cannot

Devin has no `--pure`/`--bare` equivalent and no tool pinning, so isolation is
assembled from three levers: a redirected `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (removes the user
config, its hooks, and `mcp_config.json` — every user-scope MCP server), a
redirected `XDG_DATA_HOME` (session DB — the `--no-session` counterpart — with
`credentials.toml` symlinked back in), and a throwaway `--config` that disables
`read_config_from` imports (the `--no-context-files` counterpart) and
`subagents_enabled` (the `Task` counterpart).

The leaks, verified empirically and carried in `describe()`'s caveats:
HOME-relative skill dirs (`~/.agents/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`,
`~/.codeium/*/skills`) still load — Devin discovers skills by path, not config;
`run_subagent` stays advertised even with `subagents_enabled: false`; and
`web_search`/`webfetch`/`skill`/`mcp_*` cannot be denied (permission scopes only
cover `read/edit/grep/glob/exec`).

`--permission-mode dangerous` and `--respect-workspace-trust false` are passed in
both modes: print mode cannot prompt, and the temp workspace is untrusted by
definition — same reasoning as opencode's `--auto`.

### What it cannot measure

- **`failed_calls` reads 0**: ATIF observations carry no error flag — a failed
  shell command is ordinary result content, so real tool failures are not
  distinguishable. `valid_call_rate` is meaningless for this adapter.
- **`reasoning_tokens` reads 0**: steps carry `reasoning_content` text but no
  token count; those tokens are inside `completion_tokens`.
- **`--thinking` does nothing**: effort is encoded in the model variant
  (`swe-2-medium` vs `swe-2-max`), not a flag. The detector reports
  `unsupported`, as for opencode and claude-code.
- **`stop_reason` is derived**: rc 0 + a parsed export reads `finished`; ATIF
  has no field for it, and there is no `--max-turns` equivalent.
