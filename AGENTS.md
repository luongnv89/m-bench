# AGENTS.md — runbook for an AI agent

You are being asked to find the best LLM configuration **for this specific machine**.

Read this whole file before running anything. It is written to be executed, not skimmed:
every step has a check, and the guardrails at the end are not optional.

## The premise

A public benchmark tells you which model wins on someone else's hardware, at settings you
do not run, on work you do not do. That number does not transfer. The same weights in this
repo scored **60.7 % or 80.4 %** on one identical suite depending on a single chat-template
kwarg, and the better thinking mode **flips** between one-shot code generation and
multi-turn tool loops.

So the answer is machine-local. The best configuration for user A is frequently the wrong
one for user B — different GPU, different memory ceiling, different quantisation available,
different concurrency, different work. And the configuration includes the coding agent
wrapped around the model: identical weights scored 44.9 or 68.2 on this repo's ranking suite
depending only on which harness ran them. **Your job is to measure on the machine in front
of you and end with a config that machine will actually serve.** A run that does not change
what gets served was not worth doing.

## Step 0 — establish the endpoint

```bash
echo "$BENCH_BASE_URL" "$BENCH_MODEL"
curl -s "${BENCH_BASE_URL:-http://localhost:8001/v1}/models"
```

If nothing answers, find out what is serving on this machine before doing anything else —
vLLM, llama.cpp, ollama, LM Studio and hosted APIs all work, the harness only needs an
OpenAI-compatible URL. Set both variables and re-check:

```bash
export BENCH_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8001/v1
export BENCH_MODEL=<the id the server reports>
```

Do not proceed until `/models` returns the model you intend to test.

## Step 1 — install and prove the tests

```bash
pip install -e .
./bench validate                  # must print 28/28
./bench validate --suite agentic-all   # must print 16/16
```

**If either is not 100 %, stop and fix the harness.** A failing reference solution or oracle
means the test is broken, and every model number you produce after that is meaningless.
Never "fix" this by editing the task's tests.

## Step 2 — take a baseline of what is running now

Before evaluating anything new, measure the incumbent. Without a baseline you cannot say a
candidate is better.

```bash
./bench run --suite all     --samples 2 --label "incumbent think-OFF"
./bench run --suite all     --samples 2 --label "incumbent think-ON"  --thinking --max-tokens 16000
./bench run --suite agentic-hard --samples 2 --label "incumbent agentic-OFF"
./bench run --suite agentic-hard --samples 2 --label "incumbent agentic-ON" --thinking --max-tokens 10000
```

**Always run both thinking modes.** They are different products. Reasoning-trained models
collapse without their thinking block; non-reasoning models burn thousands of tokens with
it. Reporting one mode is reporting the wrong answer half the time.

Raise `--max-tokens` with `--thinking` or reasoning eats the whole budget and the model
emits no answer — that failure looks like incompetence and is not.

## Step 3 — check the candidate can even be served here

Before downloading tens of gigabytes, check that this machine can run it:

- Does a quantisation exist that fits this hardware? Check the model's Hugging Face repo
  for the formats your server supports.
- Does the checkpoint carry what your flags assume? For MTP speculative decoding, grep
  `model.safetensors.index.json` for `mtp.` keys — absent means startup fails.
- Does the chat template match your `--tool-call-parser`? If not, the agentic suites score
  zero for reasons unrelated to the model.
- Will the weights fit next to whatever else this box serves?

Record what you checked. "It did not fit" is a valid, useful result.

## Step 4 — evaluate the candidate

On a machine with a swappable local service:

```bash
./bench compare <incumbent-model-id> <candidate-model-id> \
  --suite all --both-modes --title "<candidate> vs <incumbent>" \
  --question "Should <candidate> replace <incumbent>?"
```

This rewrites `MODEL_ID`, restarts the service, waits for health, runs both modes for each
model, restores the original, and writes the report. **It takes the endpoint down for
minutes per swap — confirm with a human first if anyone else uses it.**

`--suite` accepts the agentic suites too (`agentic`, `agentic-hard`, `agentic-all`);
compare then runs the tool-calling loop and reports agent score, calls vs par and turns,
with `--max-turns` bounding each task exactly as in `./bench run`.

Otherwise point `BENCH_BASE_URL` at each endpoint in turn and use `./bench run`.

## Step 5 — decide, and write it down

```bash
./bench report results/<date>-<name>/*.json \
  --title "..." --question "..." --verdict "..." \
  --out results/<date>-<name>/REPORT-analysis.md
```

`bench compare` already wrote a `REPORT.md` into that directory, and `bench report`
refuses to overwrite an existing report — pass `--out` or `--force`. `--notes <file.md>`
splices in your own written analysis; write that file first.

The verdict must be a decision, not a summary. Judge on:

| Signal | Weight |
|---|---|
| pass@1 on `all` | Primary for one-shot coding |
| Agent score on `agentic-hard` | Primary for tool-loop work |
| Mean output tokens, wall-clock | A model that wins by thinking 16k tokens has not won |
| Truncated / turn-limit counts | Runaway reasoning hangs real agents; weigh it heavily |
| Whether it fits alongside everything else on the box | Hard constraint |

**Differences under ~8 points at `--samples 2` are noise.** Say so rather than declaring a
winner. Raise `--samples` before calling a close race.

## Step 6 — check it through the harness you actually use

The suites above measure the model through benchkit's own tool loop, which is nobody's real
setup. If a coding agent is installed on this machine, measure through it too:

```bash
./bench harness list                     # which harnesses are installed
./bench harness models                   # which models they can reach, from your own config
./bench harness run --harness opencode -m <provider>/<model> --suite agentic-hard --samples 2
```

The harness runs use **your** opencode / pi configuration and credentials — whatever you can
run in the editor, you can benchmark. Pick the model with `-m` (any unique part of a
`provider/model` pair works), or omit it and choose from the list at the start of the run.
For a server the harness has no entry for, `--endpoint <url>` points it there for that run
only, without touching your config. All three harnesses accept it — opencode and claude-code
through a throwaway config, pi through a throwaway catalogue staged in the run's temp
directory.

Pin the reasoning level explicitly when it matters: `--effort <level>` (claude-code, passed
to `claude --effort`) and `--variant <name>` (opencode, passed to `opencode run --variant`)
work on both `bench harness run` and `bench setup run`. The value lands in the result JSON
(`summary.config.extra` and `summary.harness`) and in the auto-generated label. Either flag
on the wrong harness is an error, never silently dropped — otherwise the isolated arm of an
A/B quietly runs at the default level.

The gap is not cosmetic — on this repo's first such comparison the same model scored 67.4
through the built-in loop and 77.4 through pi. When you report a number, name the harness it
came from.

### Live mode — measure the setup you actually run

`bench harness run` isolates on purpose: no extensions, no skills, no MCP servers, so the
model is what varies. When the question is "is my daily setup any good, and what should I
change about it?", drop the isolation instead:

```bash
./bench setup --harness pi --suite agentic-hard --samples 2
```

Every isolation flag is dropped and the harness runs exactly as its owner experiences it.
`REPORT-live.md` ends in a Suggestions section derived from the run's own numbers — context
bloat traced to installed skills/MCP servers, turn-limit hits to missing tools, low
valid-call rates to schema mismatches. Treat a live result as a measurement of the whole
setup: its components may call other models, so a live number is never a model number.
Result files stamp `live` for exactly this reason.

## Step 6b — sweep whole setups, not one axis

Steps 4 and 6 vary one axis each. When the question is "what is the best setup on this
machine", vary all three at once and let the report rank them:

```bash
./bench sweep --suite agentic-hard --title "setup sweep" --dry-run \
  --setup config=qwen3.6-35b-a3b-nvfp4,thinking=both \
  --setup config=qwen3.8-27b-nvfp4-dspark,thinking=both \
  --setup config=qwen3.6-35b-a3b-nvfp4,harness=opencode,model=montimage-dgx-spark
```

Always dry-run first: it prints the matrix, the grouping, and exactly how many endpoint
restarts the sweep would cause, without touching anything.

Then, and only after a human has approved restarting the endpoint, re-run with
`--yes-restart-endpoint`. Without that flag a sweep that needs a restart refuses to start —
it never treats a non-interactive session as consent. A sweep whose setups carry no
`config=` needs no approval at all: it measures the harness and thinking axes against
whatever is already serving.

Read the report's **Ranked setups** section the way it is written: one block per
(harness, thinking mode), each with its own winner and its own noise verdict. There is no
global winner across harnesses, on purpose — see the 67.4 / 77.4 spread in step 6.

`configs/` holds recipes this cannot drive (llama.cpp, the env-tunable standalone server,
the secondary gemma backend). `bench configs` marks each one and says why; naming one in a
`--setup` is refused up front rather than halfway through.

## Step 7 — install the winner

`bench configs` is safe on any machine. **`bench apply` requires the serving host** — it
rewrites `start-qwen.sh`, and with `--restart` it takes the shared endpoint down for
several minutes. Get human approval before running it.

```bash
./bench configs                          # safe anywhere
./bench apply <config-name> --restart    # serving host only; restarts vllm-qwen
```

Then add a row to `configs/README.md` with the measured numbers. A config with no measured
row is a guess, not a known-good config.

## Guardrails

- **Never edit a task's tests, asserts or `check` to make a model pass.** That is the one
  change that destroys the value of the entire repo.
- **Never delete or overwrite an existing `results/` directory.** They are append-only; a
  superseded campaign stays next to the one that replaced it.
- **Never restart a shared serving endpoint without explicit human approval.** `bench sweep` enforces this: it refuses to start unless a human approved the restarts interactively or passed `--yes-restart-endpoint`.
- **`./bench run` executes arbitrary model output on the host.** The benchmark extracts
  code from model responses and runs it via `subprocess` with full filesystem, network
  and credential access. Set `BENCH_ISOLATE=1` to run generated code in a new network
  and mount namespace (requires `unshare`). This is a best-effort sandbox, not a VM —
  a sufficiently sophisticated payload can still escape. Never benchmark untrusted models
  on a machine you cannot afford to compromise.
- **Do not report a number you did not measure.** No estimating, no carrying a figure over
  from another machine, no quoting the model card.
- **Report failures that were the harness's fault as such.** One `run_python` bug in this
  repo cost a model 12.5 points until it was found; the model was innocent. When driving an
  external harness, a run with zero turns is almost always a wiring problem, not a model
  failure — check `docs/HARNESSES.md` before recording it.
- **Name the model as well as the harness.** `opencode` is not a score; `opencode` +
  `ollama/qwen3-coder:latest` is. Result labels and filenames carry both for this reason.
- **Never let a harness extension call a different model.** pi's extensions can; the adapter
  passes `--no-extensions` for exactly this reason. Verify the equivalent for any harness you
  add, or the benchmark silently measures something else.
- **Never quote a live-setup score as a model score.** `bench setup` measures the user's
  daily configuration, whatever models its parts actually called; results stamp `live`.
- **If a suite returns ~100 %, say it has stopped measuring** rather than calling the model
  perfect. Then write harder tasks — see `docs/REPRODUCING.md`.

## Adding tasks

Both kinds require proof the task is winnable before any model is judged:

- one-shot: a task in `benchkit/suites/`, a reference solution in `benchkit/references.py`,
  then `./bench validate` stays at 100 %.
- agentic: a task in `benchkit/agentic/tasks*.py` with `files`, `check(ws)` and an
  `oracle(ws)`, then `./bench validate --suite agentic-all` stays at 100 %.

The oracle also sets **par** — the minimum tool calls — which is what the agent score
measures efficiency against. Write the oracle the way a competent engineer would work, not
the shortest path that happens to satisfy the predicate.

## Token Efficiency
- Never re-read files you just wrote or edited. You know the contents.
- Never re-run commands to "verify" unless the outcome was uncertain.
- Don't echo back large blocks of code or file contents unless asked.
- Batch related edits into single operations. Don't make 5 edits when 1 handles it.
- Skip confirmations like "I'll continue..." Just do it.
- If a task needs 1 tool call, don't use 3. Plan before acting.
- Do not summarize what you just did unless the result is ambiguous or you need additional input.
